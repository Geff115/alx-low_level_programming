0x1E. C - Search Algorithms
C
Algorithm
 Weight: 1

Requirements:
	- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
	- All my files will be compiled on Ubuntu LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
	- My code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
	- I am not allowed to use global variables
	- No more than 5 functions per file
	- I am only allowed to use the printf function of the standard library. Any call to another function like strdup, malloc, â€¦ is forbidden.
	- The prototype of all my functions should be included in your header file called search_algos.h
	- All my header files should be include guarded

Time complexities of the different algorithms used in this project:
- O(1)
- O(n)
- O(n!)
- O(n^2)
- O(sqrt(n))
- O(log(n))
- O(nlog(n))
