0x1A. C - Hash tables
C
Algorithm
Data structure

For this Hash tables project:
	- All my files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
	- All my source codes use the Betty style.
	- I am not allowed to use global variables, so I didn't.
	- The prototype of all my functions are included in header file called hash_tables.h.
	- All my header files are include guarded.
	- The data structures are included in my header file.
	- The Hash table handles chaining collision.
	- I came up with the solutions myself, through whiteboarding, pseudocoding, and googling.
